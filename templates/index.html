  <div class=subtext><div class=author>By nskelsey</div><div class=date>Mar 3, 2014</div></div>
  <p class=body >The City Market has been around for over 40 years, its last move was to Water Street in 1993, which was only a "temporary" home.
	 After the recent fire which burned down some of the buildings on site the people of Charlottesville
         are looking for a good spot to build a permanent market place, for the next 40 years.
